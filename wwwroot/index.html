        The different links above is to access the different games using
        different values.
        <p>
          When getting something from the API using the ID value from a game you
          would need to put in the URL: https://localhost:7012/game/3. This
          would make you get the game with the ID: 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          When getting something from the API using the title value from a game
          you would need to put in the URL:
          https://localhost:7012/game?title=dragonBall. This would make you get
          the game with the the title dragonBall.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would want to get only the picture of a game you need to put in
          the URL: https://localhost:7012/images/dragonBall.jpg. This would mean
          that you need to know what the pictures name is saved in the wwwroot
          folder images. In this example we would get the dragonball picure
